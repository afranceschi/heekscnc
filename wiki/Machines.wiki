#summary Making a new machine

To make a new machine, you must make a python file in the HeeksCNC/nc folder.

You must also add an entry to "HeeksCNC/nc/machines.txt" to get this machine added to the drop-down list for the program properties.

The python file must define a class which is dervied from the class Creator ( defined in HeeksCNC/nc/nc.py ). It must also set the variable nc.creator to be an object of your class; this defines the current machine.

If you machine is similar to an existing machine, which is defined in the nc folder, then dervie your new machine from it, so that you only have to define what is different.

For example, let's make a machine which produces the same NC code as the "iso" machine, but without the line numbers.

We must make a python file, let's call it "HeeksCNC/nc/iso_no_line_numbers.py"

We must add a line to HeeksCNC/nc/machines.txt, with the file name and description "iso_no_line_numbers ISO output with no line numbers"

Our python file shall contain the following code

http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/wiki/machines/iso_no_line_numbers.py.txt


This class is derived from the CreatorIso class in iso.py, but we have redefined write_blocknum to make it do nothing.


Try it. Make a HeeksCNC program, and see that the program's "machine" drop-down, contains the "ISO output with no line numbers" machine. Select it and press "Py" and "G0" and see that there are no line numbers. Select the "Standard ISO output" and press "Py" and "G0" and see that there are line numbers again.
