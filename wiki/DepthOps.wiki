All operations have some common properties, see here:
http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/wiki/Operations

NOTE: All depth operations must have a valid cutting tool assigned to them before GCode can be produced.

===clearance height===
The absolute z height that the tool will go to, to rapid across between cuts

===step down===
The maximum depth of cut that can be done for each level.

===start depth===
The absolute z height of the top of the material

===final depth===
The absolute z height of the bottom cut level.

===rapid down to height===
The relative height, above "start depth", that the tool will rapid down to before feeding down to the first depth of cut.

===horizontal feed rate===
The feed rate, always in mm per minute, for horizontal feed moves.

===vertical feed rate===
The feed rate, always in mm per minute, for vertical feed moves.

===spindle speed===
The spindle speed, always in revs per minute, to be used.
