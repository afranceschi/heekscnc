#summary Drilling and Reaming/Boring Cycles (G81, G82-dwell and G83-peck, G85, G86, G89)

= Introduction =

The Drilling Cycle supports the inclusion of Drilling (G81), Drilling
with dwell (G82),  peck drilling (G83), Boring-No Dwell-Feed Out (G85),  Boring-Spindle Stop-Rapid Out (G86) and Boring-Dwell-Feed Out (G89) operations depending on the parameters
added to the Drilling Cycle object.

= Parameters =

== Standoff ==
    Assuming the point's location is on the surface to be drilled, the standoff value is the height ABOVE the surface at which the drilling cycle will both begin and retract to.  By default a standoff of 6.35mm (0.25 inches) will be used.

== Depth ==
    The depth is the distance in the negative Z direction from the point's Z value. By default a hole depth of 25.4mm (1 inch) will be used.

== Peck Depth ==
    The peck_depth is the amount of material to remove in each peck of the drill.  If this value is non-zero then the generated GCode will use the G83 peck drilling command.  By default a peck depth of 2.54mm (0.1 inches) will be used.

== Dwell ==
    The dwell is the time (in seconds) for which the drill should remain at the bottom of the hole to break all the 'stringers'.  If the 'peck_depth' value is zero and this dwell value is positive then the generted GCode will use the G82 (drill with dwell) cycle.

    If neither the peck depth or dwell values has a positive value then the generated GCode will include the G81 drilling command.

== Retract mode ==
   Rapid retract from bottom of hole if 0.   If set to 1, the tool will feed retract from the bottom. Depending on dwell this emits either G85 or G89 on feed retract. Incompatible with peck depth > 0.

== Spindle mode ==
  Default 0 - keep spindle running while retracting. set to 1 to stop spindle at bottom, wait for dwell seconds and before rapid retract (G86).  Incompatible with peck depth > 0.


The Retract mode and Spindle mode options are currently only supported in the emc2 machine.
