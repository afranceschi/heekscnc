#summary All Operations share these properties


= Properties =

===title===
This is just for the user to identify the operation. It can be edited. It doesn't appear in the NC code.

===comment===
This will be output in the NC code, as a comment before the operation is output.

===active===
If this is not ticked, the operation will not be output in the NC code.
This is useful, if you only want to machine some of the operations, but you don't want to delete the operations from the file.
