http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/wiki/DepthOps

===tool on side===
Choose between "Left", "Right" and "On". If "Left" or "Right" is chosen the tool path will be offset to that side of the sketch and roll-on and roll-off moves will be done. If "On" is chosen, the tool path will exactly follow the sketch and no roll-on or roll-off moves will be done.

===auto roll on===
If ticked, the "roll on point" will be automatically calculated. If unticked, you must also specify "roll on point".

===roll on point===
The point where the tool will start before feeding on an arc tangential to the start of the sketch.

===auto roll off===
If ticked, the "roll off point" will be automatically calculated. If unticked, you must also specify "roll off point".

===roll off point===
The point where the tool will end after feeding on an arc tangential to the end of the sketch.

===use start point===
If ticked "start point" can be specified.

===start point===
For an open shape, this will cut the start of the sketch off, up to the point on the sketch nearest this point. For a closed sketch, this will move the start and the end of the sketch to the point nearest this point.

===use end point===
If ticked "end point" can be specified.

===end point===
This will cut the end of the sketch off, after the point on the sketch nearest this point.
