#summary Sliptonic Car

= Pine Derby Car =

This is a pinewood derby car designed with open source software Qcad and HeeksCAD. The gcode was generated with HeeksCNC and cut on a home made cnc router.

The profile was drawn in qcad and extruded in HeeksCAD as a solid. The edges were then beveled to give the final shape.

The roughing pass was made in pycam and the smooth pass was made in Heekscnc which uses pycam.
