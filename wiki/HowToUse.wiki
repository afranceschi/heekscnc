  # Draw a sketch around the area to be milled
  # Select the sketch and select machining->operations->new zigzag operation (or in the machining tool bar if you have enabled it)
  # Change some values in the bottom left "Properties" box (at least be sure that z1 (safety height) is high enough if you are going to run the g-code in a real machine)
  # Hit the green V-button
  # Select machining->"make python script"
  # Select machining->"Post-Process" to run the script and show the g-code
  * Now you can save the g-code by clicking the save button on the machining tool bar.
