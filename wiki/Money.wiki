#summary Pay for some work to be done

= Contributing some money =

If you have some open source CAD/CAM work that needs doing, but no-one seems interested in doing the work, and you really want it doing, then send me, Dan Heeks, some money and a specification. I will add an Issue on the Issues List http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/issues/list and display the money total as a reward for whoever does the work. The specification will not be for a perfect working solution. If a software developer wants to do the work, they will ask me and then change the owner of the issue to themselves. When they think they have completed the work, I will check it and, if it matches the specification, send the total money donated for that issue to them, minus the PayPal charge, or post stamp cost.

The work will be open source. It may use the license of this project ( BSD ), or the GPL license, which BSD is compatable with. The copyright will belong to whoever writes the code, but they will be giving us all a license to use the code by adding it to this project.

The work may simply be a case of finding an existing open source solution.


Issues with donations attached:


None


This project will become a useful, free CAD/CAM solution, even without donations, but you can make it happen quicker by getting some professionals interested.
If you just want to donate a small amount, that's OK.

Feel free to add enhancement requests and bugs without donations, this is a contribution in itself.
