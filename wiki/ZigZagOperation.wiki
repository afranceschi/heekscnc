#summary ZigZag Operation

  # Draw a 3D-object
  # http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/zigzag.png Select the 3D-object and select machining->operations->new zigzag operation (or in the machining tool bar if you have enabled it)
  # Change some values in the bottom left "Properties" box (at least be sure that z1 (safety height) is high enough if you are going to run the nc code in a real machine)
  # http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/apply.png Hit the apply button
  # http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/postprocess.png Select machining->"Post-Process" to make the NC code
  * http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/savenc.png Now you can save the NC code by clicking the save button on the machining tool bar 

You need to add pycam, if you want to do zig zag machining, so the folders will need to be like this:

for Linux the pycam dir needs to be in /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pycam not PyCam, not inside HeeksCNC, then zigzag works

for Windows, I put it under HeeksCNC, like this

HeeksCNC

---bitmaps

---icons

---kurve

---nc

---PyCam

------branches

------tags

------trunk

---------pycam

---------Samples

= Properties =
All operations have some common properties, see here:
http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/wiki/Operations

===tool diameter===
The diameter of the tool

===tool type===
can be spherical, cylindrical, toroidal

== Machining Boundary ==
The bounds of the machining operation are defined by the min/max x/y parameters listed below.  These values are initially set to be larger than the combined solids area by half a cutting tool diameter added around the boundary.  If the solids, upon which this machine operation is based, are changed then the 'Reset Boundary' menu option may be used to reset the boundary based on the new solid boundaries.

===minimum x===
the left side of the machining

===maximum x===
the right hand side of the machining

===minimum y===
the bottom y of the machining

===maximum y===
the top y of the machining

===z0===
the minimum z height

===z1===
clearance height

===dx===
step over in x

===dy===
step over in y

===horizontal feed rate===
horizontal feed rate

===vertical feed rate===
vertical feed rate

===spindle speed===
spindle speed

===direction===
cut along x or along y
