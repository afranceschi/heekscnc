#summary ZigZag Operation

  # Draw a 3D-object
  # http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/zigzag.png Select the 3D-object and select machining->operations->new zigzag operation (or in the machining tool bar if you have enabled it)
  # Change some values in the bottom left "Properties" box.
  # http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/apply.png Hit the apply button
  # http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/postprocess.png Select machining->"Post-Process" to make the NC code
  * http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/savenc.png Now you can save the NC code by clicking the save button on the machining tool bar 

You need to add the opencamlib shared library file, if you want to do zig zag machining.
See http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/
For Windows, you need to build "ocl.dll" and put it in your HeeksCNC folder.
For Linux, you need to build "ocl.so" and put it in your HeeksCNC folder.

= Properties =
A ZigZag operation has all the properties for multiple depths of cut, see here:
http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/wiki/DepthOps

===tool diameter===
The diameter of the tool

===tool type===
can be spherical, cylindrical, toroidal

== Machining Boundary ==
The bounds of the machining operation are defined by the min/max x/y parameters listed below.  These values are initially set to be larger than the combined solids area by half a cutting tool diameter added around the boundary.  If the solids, upon which this machine operation is based, are changed then the 'Reset Boundary' menu option may be used to reset the boundary based on the new solid boundaries.

===minimum x===
the left side of the machining

===maximum x===
the right hand side of the machining

===minimum y===
the bottom y of the machining

===maximum y===
the top y of the machining

===step over===
step over between passes

===direction===
cut along x or along y

===material allowance===
leave this distance horizontally and vertically from the surface

===style===
this can be "one way" or "back and forth"
