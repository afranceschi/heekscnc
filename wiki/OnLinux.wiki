  # Install dev packages of wxGTK and OpenCascade
  # Build HeeksCAD, HeeksCNC, kurve and PyCam (by typing 'make' in their directories)
  # Build libarea (and copy to HeeksCNC/)
  # Build libactp (type 'make' in libactp/PythonLib) (and copy to HeeksCNC/)
  # Run HeeksCAD, open file->plugins and add HeeksCNC/libheekscnc.so.0.5.1
