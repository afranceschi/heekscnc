#summary How to compile HeeksCNC for Windows

= Introduction =

For Ubuntu build see http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/wiki/UbuntuBuild


= Details =

You need HeeksCAD ( see http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/ ), because HeeksCNC is an add-in for HeeksCAD.

Check-out all the HeeksCNC files to a folder called "HeeksCNC" ( it has to have this name at the moment ) under the HeeksCAD folder that you checked-out the heekscad project to.

Open "HeeksCNC.sln"

Press "Build Solution"

Install the latest verion of Python, ( HeeksCNC uses Python scripts extensively )

Run HeeksCAD.exe and it should load up HeeksCNC.dll and add the extra windows and menu items. You will have to go to the "View" menu and tick them to make them visible.
