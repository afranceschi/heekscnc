= Properties =
A Rough Turning operation has all common operation properties, see here:
http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/wiki/Operations

===cutter radius===
The radius of the cutting part of the tool

===orientation===
This will allow you to choose where the driven point of the tool is defined. 9 different positions:

===front angle===
The angle at the front of the tool ( diagram needed here )

===tool angle===
The angle of the tip of the tool ( diagram needed here )

===back angle===
The angle behind the tool ( diagram needed here )

===outside===
Specify if the machining will be done on the outside or inside of the bar.

===front===
Specify if the machining will be done on the front or back of the bar.

===face===
Specify if the cuts will be in Z ( horizontal ) or in X ( vertical )

===clearance===
the distance around the bar that the tool must not rapid in; the moves must become feed moves at this distance before starting to cut into the bar.

We will also need to specify the size or shape of the bar somewhere. In this operation? or maybe we need a Bar Definition operation.
