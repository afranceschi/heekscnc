#summary Importing sketches

= Introduction =
HeeksCAD can import several different file formats, including DXF and SVG files.  On this page, I want to show how to import and re-order a DXF file.


= Details =

Use the 'File' menu and click on 'Import'

Here is a drawing in Qcad that has been saved as a DXF file (Qcad's native format). Heeks seems to import Qcad files fine, except for circles- they have to be divided up into segments before Heeks can use them.

Now, you should see a line in the 'Objects' panel on the left side of the main window that says 'Sketch'. That is a collection of entities that make up your imported DXF.  Most likely, the Sketch is in some random order that HeeksCNC can't deal with. If the profile from the DXF file is one closed profile, it will be simple to fix it.  It's time to 're-order' the sketch. Look at the 'Properties' panel in the lower left corner of the screen.

Notice how it says 'bad'- well that's what it is for HeeksCNC. It can't make sense of what to do with the sketch. In simple sketches, with just one profile, it's easy just to press the 're-order' button in this drop down.  're-order' does just what it says- it connects entities to each other in proper order (ie connected end points) so that profile and pocketing can be applied later on.
In this particular sketch, there are four closed profiles. If one wants to make a pocket with three islands the sketch needs to be split and then reordered. Right click on the 'Sketch' icon in the upper left 'Object' panel and select 'Split Sketch'

Now work on each individual sketch object and use the 'Properties' panel to get the objects running the right direction- ie 'clockwise' or 'counterclockwise'.

For pocketing with islands- run the island profiles clockwise and the outer perimeter profile counter clockwise. Later on, when doing the actual pocketing machining operation, the cutter will be running in 'climb cut' mode.

After all the individual sketches are running the desired direction, they can be combined back into one sketch for a pocketing operation.  Select the 'Sketch' icons in the 'Object panel, while holding the 'Shift' key down- in some logical order. For pocketing with islands, select the outer perimeter first and the islands after that.  You can also select the Sketch entities in the graphical 'view' screen

After selecting the sketches, right click on one of them and click on 'Combine Sketches' in the drop down that appears.

Now you are ready to do machining operations to your sketch.
