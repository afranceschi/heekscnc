#summary Example files for learning and testing.

= Introduction =

The following example files contain simple geometry and machining operations.  If you're learning how to use HeeksCNC, these might be useful to see how an operation is configured.  If these files don't produce useful gcode, you may not have HeeksCNC or one of the other modules configured correctly.

*WARNING* Don't attempt to use this gcode to actually cut something unless you know what you're doing.  Many options will need to be configured for your specific machine.

== Pocketing: ==
This file contains a sketch with an eight sided closed polygon.  The selected tool is a 6.35mm (1/4") endmill.  It uses the STandard ISO Output postprocessor.
