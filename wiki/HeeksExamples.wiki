#summary Example files for learning and testing.

= Introduction =

The following example files contain simple geometry and machining operations.  If you're learning how to use HeeksCNC, these might be useful to see how an operation is configured.  If these files don't produce useful gcode, you may not have HeeksCNC or one of the other modules configured correctly.

*WARNING* Don't attempt to use this gcode to actually cut something unless you know what you're doing.  Many options will need to be configured for your specific machine.



= Examples =

== Pocketing: ==
This file contains a sketch with an eight sided closed polygon.  The selected tool is a 6.35mm (1/4") endmill.  It uses the STandard ISO Output postprocessor.  To learn more about configuring this operation refer to the PocketOperation page.

== Profiling: ==
This file contains two sketches.  Each sketch is a 1" x 1" square.  One is profiled on the inside and the other on the outside.  It uses the Linus Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC) postprocessor.  Details about configuring this operation are on the ProfileOperation page.

== Profiling leaving rims: ==
When using profiling to cut around a sketch all the way to the bottom of the material the center would disconnect from the surrounding material when reaching the bottom. To avoid this, tags can be set at the sketch which leave material at the bottom - the cutter "hops" over the tags. This example shows a rectangular cutout with four tags at the middle of each edge producing rims. Since it's a cutout I set roll_radius to 0 to avoid needless cuts in the outer material.

Note that the effect cannot be seen in XY preview.

== Drilling: ==
This file contains a sketch with a square and 8 circles.  The circles have been selected and a drilling operation applied.  Note that the size of the drawn circle doesn't affect the size of the final hole.  The circle's center is used to locate the center of the hole, but the tool selected ultimately determines the hole size.  To learn more about drilling refer to the [Drilling] page.

== Tapping: ==
This file shows 4 drilled holes. A Tapping operation has beet attached to the Drilling operation. To learn more about tapping refer to the [TappingOperation] page.

== Adaptive Roughing: ==
This file contains a 10cm x 10cm x 2.5cm solid with a pocket.  An adaptive roughing operation has been used starting at the the center.  It uses a 6.35mm (1/4") end-mill and the EMC postprocessor.  Note that the .heeks file contains the gcode from my run and is quite large (5.4MB).  To verify that adaptive roughing is working on your computer, hit the 'G0' button on the machining toolbar.  This is a cpu intensive operation and may take some time to complete.  On my computer, it takes about 3 minutes.

== ZigZag: == 
This file contains a 10cm x 10cm x 2.5cm solid with a pocket.  A zigzag operation has been applied setting the safeheight at 3mm above the top and stepping over 3mm in Y dimension and .5 in X dimension.  ZigZag (pycam) can be extremely slow, especially if the dx and dy (stepover) parameters are small.

== Counterbore: ==
This file uses the earlier drilling example and adds a counterbore operation.  The drilling tool has been changed to an 1/8" drill bit and the end mil is used for the counterbore operation.

== ScriptOp: ==
This file shows how the point and sketch information is presented from the ScriptOp operation.  It uses a Python subroutine to generate a spiral toolpath at each of the point locations attached to the ScriptOp object.

Currently only export of attached points and sketches is supported.
