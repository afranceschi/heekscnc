#summary Example files for learning and testing.

= Introduction =

The following example files contain simple geometry and machining operations.  If you're learning how to use HeeksCNC, these might be useful to see how an operation is configured.  If these files don't produce useful gcode, you may not have HeeksCNC or one of the other modules configured correctly.

*WARNING* Don't attempt to use this gcode to actually cut something unless you know what you're doing.  Many options will need to be configured for your specific machine.



= Examples =

== Pocketing: ==
This file contains a sketch with an eight sided closed polygon.  The selected tool is a 6.35mm (1/4") endmill.  It uses the STandard ISO Output postprocessor.  To learn more about configuring this operation refer to the PocketOperation page.

== Profiling: ==
This file contains two sketches.  Each sketch is a 1" x 1" square.  One is profiled on the inside and the other on the outside.  It uses the Linus Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC) postprocessor.  Details about configuring this operation are on the ProfileOperation page.

== Drilling: ==
This file contains a sketch with a square and 8 circles.  The circles have been selected and a drilling operation applied.  Note that the size of the drawn circle doesn't affect the size of the final hole.  The circle's center is used to locate the center of the hole, but the tool selected ultimately determines the hole size.  To learn more about drilling refer to the [Drilling] page.
