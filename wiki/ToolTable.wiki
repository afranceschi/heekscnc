#summary Cutting Tool objects define Tool Table

= Introduction =

The Cutting Tool object defines a single tool in what will eventually become a tool table.  For each Cutting Tool object, a G10 L1 command is added to the GCode to add the cutting tool to the tool table 'on the fly'.

The Drilling Cycle objects also refer to these Cutting Tool objects and add a 'selct tool' command immediately prior to the drilling cycle commands generated.


= Details =
The Cutting Tool object has been added to define a single tool.  It's GCode produces a 'G10 L1' command to add a tool to the logical tool table from within the GCode program.  (from the EMC2 documentation).

At the moment, only the Drilling Cycle object refers to it.  This reference is used for graphics generation when the operator selects the Drilling Cycle object.  It is also used to generate the 'select tool' command prior to listing the drilling cycles in the GCode.
