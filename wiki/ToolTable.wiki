#summary Cutting Tool objects define Tool Table

= Introduction =

The Cutting Tool object defines a single tool in what will eventually become a tool table.

A default tool table may be setup so that it is automatically loaded on a 'File'->'New' command.


= Details =
The Cutting Tool object has been added to define a single tool.

The tool may be chosen to any of the NC operation objects within their Properties page.

= Properties =

The list of properties changes based on the type of tool selected.

== Type ==

The type property can be one of;

 - "Drill Bit"

 - "Centre Drill Bit"

 - "End Mill"

 - "Slot Cutter"

 - "Ball End Mill"

 - "Chamfering Bit"

 - "Engraving Bit"

== Title ==

All NC operation objects have a title.  The cutting tool's title may be set automatically by the CuttingTool module so that the name is representative of the various parameters chosen.  If the user changes the title to some value that is sufficiently different from the automatically generated name, that name will remain unchanged.


=== Milling/Drilling tool parameters ===

==== Diameter ====

The diameter should be expressed in the same units as for the rest of the model. For a chamfering tool, this should be the diameter at the tool's widest point.

==== Tool Length Offset ====

This is the length of the cutting tool in the same units as for the rest of the model.


==== Flat Radius ====

This represents the area directly beneath the end of a milling cutter that forms a flat surface.  An endmill would have a flat radius that is half the tool's diameter.  A ball-endmill would have a flat radius of zero.  A chamfering tool that uses replaceable carbide inserts might have a positive flat radius.  A 'V-Carve' bit would be represented as a chamfering tool with a flat radius of zero (i.e. a pointed end)

==== Corner Radius ====

This represents the curve from the bottom of the cutting tool around to the edge.  An end-mill would have a corner radius of zero while a ball-endmill would have a corner radius that was half the diameter of the cutting tool.

==== Vertical Cutting Edge Angle ====

This is the angle between the tools centre line and that of the cutting surface.  For a normal endmill this would be zero.  i.e. the cutting surface is parallel with the tool's centre line.  For a chamfering bit, however, this might be something like 45 degrees representing the slanting cutting surface the tool makes.

==== Material ====

This is the material that makes up the cutting edge of the cutter.  It may be set to either 'High Speed Steel' or 'Carbide'.

==== Automatic Title ====

When the various parameters of the cutting tool are adjusted, the system attempts to find a more appropriate title for the cutting tool so that it is easily selected from the Tools list.  There are occasions, however, where the user may wish to manually assign a tool name.  This flag is set to 'true' by default so that the object's title is automatically changed to reflect the tool's parameters.  If the user manually edits the object title then this flag will implicitly be changed to 'false'.  i.e. from this point on, the manually assigned title will be used.  If, on the other hand, the user wishes to reinstate the automatic naming function, this parameter may be changed.



A default tool table may be configured by saving a HeeksCNC data file that already contains a set of tool definitions into a file called 'default.tooltable'.  The process involves adding cutting tools to a HeeksCNC model before using the 'Export' command beneath a right mouse click on the Tools icon.  This allows the tool definitions to be saved to a file.  If the file is called 'default.tooltable' and is located in one of the two possible directories then these tools will be automatically added to all new data files.

The default.tooltable file may come from either the user's default configuration directory (HOME directory on Linux and "c:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data" on Windows) or it must be located in the same directory as the HeeksCNC.so or HeeksCNC.DLL file.
