#summary Adaptive Roughing operation

= Introduction =

1. Make a solid with a big flat surface on top of it

2. Make a solid on top of it and/or a pocket in it

3. Rotate the view so that it is seen straight from the top and draw a sketch loosely around the pocket or the solid

4. Select the big flat solid and the sketch and, if you made some, the solids on the big flat solid.  You can, optionally, also select a cutting tool object.

5. Make an adaptive roughing operation, press

6. At the options list, on the left (as default), set the starting point somewhere in the middle of the pocket or somewhere not on the solid you made on the flat surface.

7. Make the Python script, press

8. Create the NC code and see the toolpath, press

http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bitmaps/postprocess.png


There will be some toolpath.
If there is no toolpath, have a look in the terminal ( if running Linux ) to see if there are any Python script errors, like you haven't built actp.so

== Open Shapes ==
be careful to set the starting point somewhere not on the upper solids

try moving the starting point a bit

== Pocketing ==
To specify a boundary that the tool must stay inside, you must use a solid, like this ( be careful to set the starting point somewhere in the middle of the pocket )
