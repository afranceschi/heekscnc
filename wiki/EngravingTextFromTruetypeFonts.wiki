#summary How to generate engravable text using TrueType fonts.

= Introduction =
There is an _Add Text_ function in HeeksCAD but the Qcad fonts it's using arent that great for engraving text. 

An easy way to create text outlines is TrueTypeTracer by Chris Radek. This program creates a DXF file which can be imported into HeeksCAD.

= Details =

== Prerequisites ==

You need to install TrueTypeTracer from http://www.timeguy.com/cradek/01276453959 . 

This is a Linux - only program. It shouldnt be too hard to compile for Windows but I'm lacking that infrastructure.

== Steps ==  

* Choose a font and convert the text string to DXF like so:

{{{
$ truetype-tracer-dxf -f/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSansOblique.ttf HeeksCNC >heekscnc.dxf
}}}

* Import [http://heekscnc.googlecode.com/files/heekscnc.dxf heekscnc.dxf] into HeeksCAD.

The text will come out really huge. Scale it to desired size. 

* Reorder the sketch

The sketch will be named 'ENTITIES 0' . Look at the properties of this sketch - _order_ will likely be _bad_. Choose _reorder_ - order should now be _multiple_.

* Pocket and/or Contour and/or Profile the resulting sketch.

However, the Contour operation currently gives me an 'Error converting sketch to face: BRep_API: command not done' on the same sketch whereas Profiling and Pocketing worked fine (r1227).

=== Note on Inkscape ===

Neil Underwood did a nice [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wThpU-XJ19o video tutorial] on extruding text in Heekscad  . He suggests using the [http://www.bigbluesaw.com/saw/big-blue-saw-blog/general-updates/big-blue-saws-dxf-export-for-inkscape.html Big Blue Saw DXF export plugin] for Inkscape 

This worked as well but I had a lot more massaging to do before I had useful results.

TrueTypeTracer is a bit cleverer in exporting the outlines. It uses biarcs wheras the Big Blue Saw DXF export plugin simplifies everything to lines.
