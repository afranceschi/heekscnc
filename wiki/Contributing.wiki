#summary How you can help with HeeksCNC

= Want to help? =

If you want to add or change something, first add an Issue to the Issue List http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/issues/list

If you want to fix an existing Issue that already has an owner, ask the existing owner if you can do it. It is possible to change the owner of an issue.

When you've fixed the issue, commit your changes with SVN, mentioning the issue number in the comment, then go to the Issue List and mark your issue as done.

I will need to add your Google account username as a member of this project, before you can commit code with SVN.
