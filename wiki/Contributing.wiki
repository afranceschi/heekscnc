If you want to add or change something, first add an Issue to the Issue List http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/issues/list


When you've fixed the Issue, commit your changes with SVN, mentioning the Issue number in the comment, then go to the Issue List and mark your Issue as done.

I will need to add your Google account username as a member of this project, before you can commit code with SVN.
